# Ants Simulation
A simulation of the natural behavior of ants.

## About the Project
The ants leave the anthill in search of a food source. In doing so, they leave behind red pherhormones. If a food source is found, an ant leaves behind yellow pherhormones. And tries to find back to the heap via the red pherhormone trail. Other ants that find the yellow pherhormone trail follow it to the source. 

The whole visualization is done with Python and matplotlib. I plan to further improve the alogrithm to create even more natural behavior and possibly add obstacles. Also, the simulation is currently very inefficient and should be improved further. 

## Sequence diagram
The basic logic is as follows:
